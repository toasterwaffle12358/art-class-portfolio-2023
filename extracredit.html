                        1. How did you use your own ideas to make art?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        I used my own ideas when creating art by combining my blender and 3D rendering skills with the 
                        phtography skills I am learning in this class in order to make something unique and interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        2. What new techniques or processes did you learn?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        I learned how to use new editing tecniques and software during this course. I had heard of darktable before this course, but had never
                        actually used it. I also learned about code based processing filters like pixel sorting. I will be using the new editing skills I learned
                        during this class in my 3D rendering workflow in order to get better results.
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        3. How is your artwork about who you are or what you like?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        My artwork is less about a specific subject or idea, than it is about the process of photography. I find editing and processing photos 
                        interesting and fun, and I want my photos to show the fun that I had while making them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        4. What did you try that you weren't sure about?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        Not really anything. I tried a few new things, like pixelsorting, but I wasnt worried cause there wasnt really any time constraint, and I 
                        knew it would work out in the end. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        5. Did you engage with your peers for feedback?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        No, not really. I got feedback during the friday showcase days, but that was after I was already done making the photo anyways.
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        6. How did you respond to challenges as you worked?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        I faced a few challanges during this course with software not working the way I wanted it to, thankfully in all of these situations I was able to just switch to different software. (like with switching from lightroom to darktable because I didnt want to use adobe).
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        7. When did you step back and analyze your work during your projects?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        Honestly I didnt very often, a lot of my work was made in short fast bursts, so there wasnt much time to reflect. Sometimes after I turn something in, I gain a new perspective on it, but it doesn't matter then because I already turned it in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="settingheader">
                        8. Did you use technology as a tool?
                    </p>
                    <p class="growthanswer">
                        Yes, a lot. I spent signifigantly more time editing and tweaking photos after I took them than I spent actually taking photos.
                        often the base photo would just be used as a texture in an entirely cg environment.
